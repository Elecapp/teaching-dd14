### Description
In the first visualization, the aim is to show the nature of the results from the query “avocado” on Google, from a Mexico and USA perspective. The ranking demonstrates how results that are actually about the issues linked to avocado are buried under an extensive corpus of links related to the fruit’s healthy trend.
Furthermore, comparing these two countries query results, we find out that they are linked to the actual role our main actors play on the scene: Mexican results are more linked to production while the ones from the USA focus more on healthy diets and trends.

It is interesting how the main issue results are on the Mexican side: the country is facing a big impact on the environment that comes from this intensive productivity. At the [21st](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/produccion-aguacate-deforestacion-bosques-pino-plantios-ilegales/) and [41st](https://aristeguinoticias.com/1501/mexico/extorsion-del-crimen-en-michoacan-provoco-aumento-de-precios-de-limon-y-aguacate/) place we can find links about different issues; the first one is about the environment while the second one reports the social concerns linked to criminal cartels.

The visualization is composed of three main columns: on the two sides, the results from USA and Mexico are listed by Google ranking, while in the center they are linked to the corresponding topic to better highlight the pages’ contents.



### Protocol

![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocols_p1.svg' | relative_url }})

This protocol is the result of different experiments to show how difficult it is to come across information about avocado production concerns.
Since we knew from the previous research in phase 1 that Mexico and USA are respectively the leading producer and importer of this product, we decided to set the two queries in both languages, searching for “aguacate” and “avocado.” To speed the process, we used Instant Data Scraper to harvest data and to list the results by ranking along with the links.
 For both queries, we selected the first 50 results, highlighting the website pages about issues connected to avocado production, when they appeared. The categorization is aimed to show better the content of the pages we found in the queries results.
