### Description
<i>What if Social Credit System is not the only credit score system in the world?</i> That’s what we asked ourselves as we went deeper into the analysis of our theme. The visualization helps to understand the <strong>overlapping</strong> aspects of each credit system, thanks also to the interaction method: users can click on the buttons of each credit system to <strong>compare</strong> them better.
We though it was interesting and also very useful to analyze the different types of credit scores, both to better understand Social Credit System itself and to have a general view of the topic.
There are other four main credit score systems used nowadays: Schufa, FICO Score, Vantage Score and Sesame Credit. This visualization aims to explore the <strong>differences</strong> and the <strong>similarities</strong> among these systems and it’s useful to focus the attention on the huge differences between Social Credit System and the others.
The three western credit systems are created by companies and are based just on people’s financial behaviour. The score, which is not free to see, is the indicator of just how much a person is reliable in terms of loans and finance.
Sesame Credit is the Chinese system that lays in the middle: it comes from a company, Alibaba, and it gives a score based on people’s financial behaviour. Moreover, it’s based also on dating habits, shopping history and much more. It’s somewhat the precursor to Social Credit System, which is the <strong>only one created by the government</strong>, who works in collaboration with Chinese giant companies. It’s based not just on online behaviour but also offline, and according to your score you can have <strong>benefits and punishments</strong>.

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocol2.svg' | relative_url }})

At first, we wanted to make a comparison about credit systems between the different countries in the world and China. But then we found out that it would have been more interesting to structure the research depending on different credit systems. After a first research on which credit systems are in use nowadays, we started to search for reliable information about them, both through Wikipedia and official websites, collecting every comparable information. After this analysis we were able to design a visualization to highlight the main differences and the common aspects among the five systems.

First of all, to create the dataset, we made a list with all the parameters we wanted to explore. Then we selected some of them to create the dataset with the following items: credit system name, description, year of introduction, country, founder, who use the score, kind of data and provenience, number of users, country population, score range, section of range, average score, benefits, punishments and free seeing score. In the dataset each row is a different credit system and each column is a comparable aspect. We filled the file with the information obtained with the research.
