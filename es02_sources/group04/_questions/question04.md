### Description
Since it seemed from the previous protocol that the controversy didnâ€™t exist in China, we though it was a problem of the query, so we changed it. This visualization is useful to grasp immediately the <strong>comparison between the two previous results</strong> (on the left we have the 50 results on google and on the right the 50 of Baidu of the previous visualization) <strong>and the new research with the new query</strong> (in the middle). 
What we could understand was that even though <i>Social Credit System controversy</i> was the most controversial query that we could search for, still the results are not at all similar to the western ones. They are just a little bit more debated than the previous query. 
To get to this point, we searched for multiple different queries on <i>baidu.com</i>, such as <i>Social Credit System disadvantages</i>, <i>Social Credit System attitude</i>, <i>Social Credit System suggestions</i>, <i>Social Credit System opinions</i>, before arriving to the one with the most controversial results that we could find, <i>Social Credit System controversy</i>.
All the websites have some information about it but there are <strong>different approaches</strong>: neutral, so the website is just giving neutral information about the topic, generally explaining what it is; positive, so in this case the website is in favor of the system itself; negative, so the website is expressing itself against the system, being concerned and uncertain; then both positive and negative, so the article speaks for both parts. This first categorization helped us with the approaches categories for the next protocols.
So, does the controversy exist in China? We still kept the duality in the next protocols to fully answer this question.

### Protocol
![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/protocol4.svg' | relative_url }})

Starting from the previous protocol, we implemented the research with a new query, again on Firefox browser and on incognito mode. We did the same process for these new 50 results and then we matched them with the previous results. Thanks to this more specific analysis it came to light that in Chinese websites the approach is anyway less controversial.

Even the dataset itself was at first made of 100 results, divided in google.com and baidu.com and then implemented with the other results.
