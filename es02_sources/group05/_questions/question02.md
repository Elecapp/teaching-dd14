### Description
This data visualization displays the categorization and the amount of results for each actor related to the queries. On the left side are shown the first 50 results of the study drugs query and on right side the ones related to smart drugs. The actors are displayed with the labels in the middle of the chart connected by both sides to the alluvial path shapes that shows the amount of result per class, which are set in the upper part of the representation. The final visualization gives a clear preview of the actors that are more engaged with the cause and that "news providers" are the main ones. The interactivity of this graph helps to highlight the desired component for a better and sharpened view by clicking the classes in the upper part and by hovering over the actors. The second visualization shows off a bar chart divided per study drug. According to the first phase of the project, Adderall, Ritalin and Modafinil were the most used and the outcome shows if the top 50 results on Google search query were related (selected in orange), partially related (blue) or not related (grey) to the academic world. The aim of the classification within this groups was to find out which drug is mentioned more in relation to the phenomenon and that Adderall is more connected with the academic world. Nevertheless, students prefer it to others for its quick and more lasting effect.

The second stage of the research is dedicated to find out the drug that is more connected with the academic world. Keywords such as Study drugs and Smart drugs were used with the research browser criteria on Firefox incognito mode, with the location set to USA and refined the top 50 URLs for each query. The two main points are the classification of the URL rankings and the analysis of the quantity of the results for each actor present in Excel. The draft of the first visualization was built in Rawgraph as a base tool and transferred to Adobe Illustrator for further editing. Moving forward, Adderall, Modafinil and Ritalin queries were added to the research with the same search criteria. The second visualization was built in Adobe Illustrator according to the data obtained.
