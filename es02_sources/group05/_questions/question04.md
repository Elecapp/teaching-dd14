### Description
On the base of the Protocol 3 a new question appeared. What is the perception of the publishers? In this treemap representation every cluster correspond to one of the newspaper selected. Within the clusters are highlighted the causes that lead a student to take brain enhancers. In orange are displayed the main reasons strictly related to college habits, instead of the grey ones that are not associated to studies topics. In this way a total view on the reasons for the misuse of stimulants among students is displayed. The causes that stand out mostly are "performance", "focus" and "pressure", according to the newspapers. By hovering on each button it will be highlighted the cause mentioned by each newspaper in its cluster.


In order to understand the causes that lead a student to use a brain enhancer like Adderall, an amount of 11 categories were created to classify the topics given in each article. The categories selected include stress, lazy, competition, selling, workload, focus, socialize, pressure, addiction, performance and get high. All of the 146 articles selected that were talking about Adderall and students were checked and analyzed one by one for a better classification. By using the built spreadsheet in Rawgraph a first draft treemap was created and then refined in Adobe Illustrator for the final displaying.
