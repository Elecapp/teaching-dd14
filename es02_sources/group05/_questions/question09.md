### Description
The data obtained from Protocol 8 required more answers. How those topics are related and which are more connected? Here it can be discovered how kids are mostly related to school/studies, women to depression and men being mostly connected with success which can seem bizarre nowadays, however, this research includes the time starting from 1922 to 2014, when the gender roles underwent the major shift. The purpose of this visualization is to display the relation between topics. Hovering over a point will highlight other topics that it is linked with.


The first part of the data gathering started from Google Images, Google Search and Pinterest, that were used as main websites to find the posters for those medication. With time names and goal for the medication that have more or less same constitution were added. Keywords like, Metadate, Benzedrine, Ritalin, Concerta, Amphetamines, Nurofocus, Modafinil, ADHD Meds, Methadone, Dexamil, Daytrana, Vyvanse, Dexedrine, Tenuate, Adderall and Intuniv has been used for the posters research. Then the posters were refined according to the main themes observable. They include: Focus, Weight, Failure, Soldier, Man, Success, Bad Kid, School/, Pathology, Depression, Energy, Family, Happiness, Good Kid and Woman. Than it was created a Gephi network to analyze the connection among the themes. Than the network was transferred it to Adobe Illustrator and refined. Each theme shows the number of posters related to it and the more posters themes have in common, the thicker is the line that connect them.
