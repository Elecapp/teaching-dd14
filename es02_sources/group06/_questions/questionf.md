### Description
In this visualization main/recurring characters of TV series that are addicted or have abused opioids are displaced in chronological order. The order takes into account the year of episode in which they the character appear (if always addicted) or in which his abuse started/occurred.
First of all, it is possible to spot an increase in the number of characters portrayed as addicts. It is also evident that the large majority of them are male. Furthermore, the ethnicity of most of them is Caucasian, with no representation of afro Americans. It is also evident that a lot of characters have a stressful job and it emerge. However, itâ€™s interesting to spot that lately in time there has been a slight change in the gender (more women) and also in the ethnicity (few Hispanics).

The aim of this Protocol has been to analyse deeper the image of important characters of TV series portrayed as addicted. In fact, it is possible to get a high number of information about those fictional people and that gives the chance to compare them on multiple points.

Starting from the TV series of Protocol 5, we decided to identify the context of mention of opioids and the specific character involved reading the plot of found episodes (and when needed of the series) on TVFANATIC and IMDb. After we found information about the characters on FANDOM.wikia and finally understood his role (main, recurring, secondary character) on Wikipedia. We collected the data in an Excel file and decided to focus on main and recurring characters.
