### Description
Before define the entry point of the migration country--Malaysia, we firstly wanted to have a general understanding of the connection of the three major ethnic groups. For this reason the networks showed how 3 Wikipedia pages of “Malaysian Chinese ”“Malaysian Indian ”and “Bumiputera (Malaysia)”(means the local people) connected to each other. Each node is one Wikipedia page and the colors of the nodes represent the Degree value. We analyzed them closely and we found that there is no connection between Malaysian Chinese and Bumiputera(malaysia). We are curious about what the topics related to Malaysian Chinese are, and we thought that the visualization is still an outer overview, not well localized so we need a deeper analysis about the malaysian Chinese in the next step.





### Protocol

![example of protocol]({{ '/assets/images/protocols/Q1.png' | relative_url }})

This step stared with the intention to investigate the network built around the connection of three main ethnic groups in Malaysia.  

We decided to use Wikipedia pages of “Malaysian Chinese ”“Malaysian Indians” and ”Bumiputera(Malaysia)” to explore it and create networks of them which were aimed to trying to understand which areas they are most connected in. 

We made the final network starting with these three pages “Malaysian Chinese ”“Malaysian Indians” and ”Bumiputera(Malaysia)”, using Seealsology with distance 2 and we found that Wikipedia doesn’t create a tight connection between Malaysian Chinese and Bumiputera(Malaysia).
